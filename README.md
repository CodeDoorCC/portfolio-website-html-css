Build a website to showcase other projects

During your time at CodeDoor you will build projects. To showcase them it is ideal to have a portfolio website. Please use either your own code or a template to construct your portfolio site. If you are very new to coding it makes sense to use a template. It will help you to learn about how a simple website is structured. Sources for templates are: https://html5up.net/ or https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/examples/

Please use HTML and CSS
